Basic concept of an idle game in JavaScript

This code creates a variable "money" that starts at 0. When the user clicks the button with the id "click-button", the function increases the money variable by the amount of moneyPerClick and updates the HTML element with the id "money" to show the updated amount. The code also has a setInterval function, this will increase the money by moneyPerSecond every second.

You can add additional features, like upgrades, items or levels to this basic concept.
